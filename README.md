# first-python-capstone
This is my first big python project that is the section ending project for codecademy's python course
It is a terminal text game.

-For my first project, I had an idea to make a virtual game room in the terminal. It is basically a hub with several mini games that you can play.
-I wanted it to have the option to jump into a game and when your done with it, you can either restart it or go back to the main hub.
-There were a lot of challenges, mainly in the sense of getting the games to restart and play to completion until the user wants to quit.
-I was also really excited that I was able to get the program to switch from one file to another file, that was game changing!
-I think in the hangman game, there is the best restart mechanic and I want to try and get that for all the games.
-I am also starting to understand the concept of OOP and I think if I learn more about it, I can remake this project in an OOP manner and it would actually end up being easier to implement.
-All in all it was very exciting to be able to create something thats pretty big from scratch and I cant wait to add even more games and fix some bugs.
-I think my ultimate goal is to be able to make some of the games also have the option to be either single player or multiplayer!
-It ended up being a bit complicated and I am going to keep working on cleaning up the code and making sure that it works as intended!-
